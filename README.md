## Base

### Description

The first assignment is to create the caster base.  The base's dimensions are 200 mm x 120 mm and 8 mm thick.  It has 6 holes 10 mm wide and 20 mm from the edge equally spaced along the edges.

This is how you will write image code for INTERNALLY STORED images on your repo.   just FYI.

### Reflection

This was my first Onshape part and [following along with Dr. Shields made it super easy.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93BFUD-HAG8&feature=emb_title&scrlybrkr=5670f0b4)  I learned about 
* sketching (shortcut **shift-s**)
* constructions lines (shortcut **Q**)
* dimensions (shortcut **D**)
* extruding both add and remove (shortcut key **E**)
* linear patterns (no shortcut)

Onshape is awesome.  I found it really helpful to rename all my sketches.  It is going to be a GREAT year in engineering.

## Mount

### Description
The mount is the second part of the caster. The mounts dimensions are 120 mm by 120 mm and 8 mm thick. It has 4 holes that are 10 mm and 20mm from the wall. There is a 5th hole centered in the middle of the square that is 25 mm.

### Reflection
Following a video made it really easy to construct the mount with little problems. This part felt pretty easy, as it was similar to the base, part 1, that I just created.

### Reflection
In Part 3 I learned how to fillet and chamferfor a smoother edge, and mirror for easy copy and pasting.
