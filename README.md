## Base

### Description

The first assignment is to create the caster base.  The base's dimensions are 200 mm x 120 mm and 8 mm thick.  It has 6 holes 10 mm wide and 20 mm from the edge equally spaced along the edges.

This is how you will write image code for INTERNALLY STORED images on your repo.   just FYI.

### Reflection

This was my first Onshape part and [following along with Dr. Shields made it super easy.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93BFUD-HAG8&feature=emb_title&scrlybrkr=5670f0b4)  I learned about 
* sketching (shortcut **shift-s**)
* constructions lines (shortcut **Q**)
* dimensions (shortcut **D**)
* extruding both add and remove (shortcut key **E**)
* linear patterns (no shortcut)

Onshape is awesome.  I found it really helpful to rename all my sketches.  It is going to be a GREAT year in engineering.

## Mount

### Description
The mount is the second part of the caster. The mounts dimensions are 120 mm by 120 mm and 8 mm thick. It has 4 holes that are 10 mm and 20mm from the wall. There is a 5th hole centered in the middle of the square that is 25 mm.

### Reflection
Following a video made it really easy to construct the mount with little problems. This part felt pretty easy, as it was similar to the base, part 1, that I just created.

## Fork

### Description
This is the third part of the caster. The main circle is

### Reflection
In Part 3 I learned how to fillet and chamfer for a smoother edge, and mirror for easy copy and pasting. I got more familiar with extruding.

## Tire

### Description
Part 4 is the tire, which goes over the wheel on the caster.

### Reflection
WIth this project, I learned some dimensioning tricks, such as how to dimension an angle and diameter. I also practiced revolving a sketch.I practiced filleting, revolving, and circular patterns.

## Wheel

### Description
The tire will go over this wheel. This is one of the last parts to the caster.

## AxleCollarBearings

### Description
These tiny parts are going to be what connects the wheel to the base/mount of the caster.

### Reflection
These quick tiny parts were pretty simple. I did learn how to carve into a cylinder on the axle and that was cool.
